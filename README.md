# A.I.-Virtual-Desktop-Assistant
My First A.I. Desktop Virtual Assistant ---ZIRA---


This A.I. Virtual desktop assistant name is ZIRA. This assistant is created using python which includes all the things needed in this assistant for a simple life. For instance I am
a coder and i always open google, youtube, powershell window, visual studio code and always listen to music sometimes i also need to configure my laptops and desktops so i have 
added all the features for opening these applications. You can also send emails to any person securely without anyone to see your id or password. I have also added the feature 
which opens a web browser into your current desktop.I have added a feature from which you can ask the wikipedia of any thing, it can be the name of a person, place, kingdoms, 
history, etc. Just say 'thing' + wikipedia.

In Future i will add feature which search things entered by the user using a search engine. If someone wants to give suggestions for adding more features i am free to contact.

This A.I. is my first mega project i have created. In future i will also create many games but first i want to work on this Virtual Assistant.

What's New: Now the Assistant will ask you for the confirmation for the content you have spoken for the mail. If you will say yes then the email sending process will continue and if you say no then ZIRA will ask you to input the content you want to send to the sender. 

What's New :  I have updated my assistant now you can find your public and local ip address using it. If you are feeling bored, just say "I am feeling bored" to ZIRA and it will make you happy by asking if you want to listen jokes or music.

New! :  Now you can confirm the mail before sending. ZIRA will ask you whether to send the email you have spoken or not. If you will say yes then it will continue to the process of sending email. If you will say no, then it will let you write the content of the email.

Thank You !
