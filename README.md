# A.I.-Virtual-Desktop-Assistant
__My First A.I. Desktop Virtual Assistant ---ZIRA---__

## INTRODUCTION
__This A.I. Virtual desktop assistant name is ZIRA__. This assistant is created using python which includes all the things needed in this assistant for a simple life. For instance I am
a coder and i always open google, youtube, powershell window, visual studio code and always listen to music sometimes i also need to configure my laptops and desktops so i have 
added all the features for opening these applications. You can also send emails to any person securely without anyone to see your id or password. I have also added the feature 
which opens a web browser into your current desktop.I have added a feature from which you can ask the wikipedia of any thing, it can be the name of a person, place, kingdoms, 
history, etc. Just say 'thing' + wikipedia.

In Future I will add feature which search things entered by the user using a search engine. 

>__*This A.I. is my first mega project i have created. In future i will also create many games but first i want to work on this Virtual Assistant.*__

## *Updates*
__Updated on :  25-05-21__
*What's New*: Now the Assistant will ask you for the confirmation for the content you have spoken for the mail. If you will say yes then the email sending process will continue and if you say no then ZIRA will ask you to input the content you want to send to the sender. 

__Updated on :  10-06-21__
*What's New* :  I have updated my assistant now you can find your public and local ip address using it. If you are feeling bored, just say "I am feeling bored" to ZIRA and it will make you happy by asking if you want to listen jokes or music.

__Updated on :  015-06-21__
*New!* :  Now you can confirm the mail before sending. ZIRA will ask you whether to send the email you have spoken or not. If you will say yes then it will continue to the process of sending email. If you will say no, then it will let you write the content of the email.

__Updated on :  21-06-21__
*New!* : Now you can open office applications using ZIRA. You can also open notepad and chrome using ZIRA. Now, the thing which ZIRA cannot do is maintained by herself.
__The BEST Thing Added ! : Now you can shutdown and restart by saying : "shutdown this pc" for shutting down and "restart this pc" for restarting windows.

__Updated on : 22-06-2021__
* *New!* : Now ZIRA will stop for sometime when the user has asked her to open something. And also new things were added like when you will say "thank you" to ZIRA, before it exit's without asking the user, but now she will ask whether to exit or continue by saying yes or no. Now she will wait after when the user ask her for printing the machine information and in system properties too. 
* Shut down process has been updated, as when the user asks ZIRA to shut down his machine it takes about 3 seconds to shut down the pc and also in the restart process now the shut down process is done without waiting, it is done in 0 seconds.

__Updated on : 23-06-2021__
*New !*: Now you can search for anything from ZIRA it will show you the google search results, You have to just say "ZIRA search" and it you will again ask for what to search in the google, say what to search and you will be moved to your default browser with the results.

> __New file !!!!!!!  :  A new file is uploaded "A.I. Desktop Virtual Assistant__ZIRA__ __(New with modes).py"__. 
* This new file is a well organized with modes and just same as the old one. Now the new one contains modes by which you can enter in new modes by saying applications or apps for open app mode, office for open office applications mode, feelings mode for your feelings, web for google search and wikipedia and the system related is separate you don't need to turn on the different mode.

__Updated on : 24-06-2021__
Changes: Some minor issues has been fixed and "How are you ?" question asked by the user is added. Youtube search is now available, now you can say what to play on youtube. For example you can say "Play shape of you song on youtube." and you will be moved to youtube.com with the song being played.

__Updated on : 25-06-2021__
* Changes : Now ZIRA won't ask "what to open in youtube" again after you have said "open (something) on or in youtube". The "something" is opened in the youtube without taking the whole query. You can say "open (something) on youtube" or "open (something) in youtube". It will take the query as necessary as if the user says "play shape of you song on youtube" the youtube will be opened and only shape of you song is being searched not the whole sentence. 
* *__New !__* : Now you can send whatsapp messages with both the assistants with modes or simple one. You have to just say send message and it will ask you the number, what to write and time in 24 hour format (first hour and then minutes diffs). You can also put the wait time it means that when the time for sending the message the whatsapp will be opened and the message is typed automatically at the given time and in the contact's chat. And if you have put the wait time 5 seconds then it will wait for 5 seconds and then the message will be sent. Remember if the browser isn't in full screen the message won't be sent.
